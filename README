The program will allow to play a game of Sudoku on 9x9 grids from terminal.
You will be allowed to select between 4 different levels (Easy, Intermediate, Hard, Nightmare).
To compile, please use the Makefile (just type "make" from terminal).
To play, we suggest to put the terminal to full screen.
The program is linux-specific.
